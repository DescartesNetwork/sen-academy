      content: `<p style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain has been and continues to be a hot topic of discussion among developers and investors globally in general, and in Vietnam in general. Thousands of projects revolve around products of blockchain technology such as cryptocurrency (crypto), decentralized finance (DeFi), or play-to-earn games (GameFi) are drawing in huge investments up to tens of millions of dollars.</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">As of November 2021, the Library of Congress has counted 103 countries where the government has directed the development of regulations and priorities for cryptocurrencies and financial institutions related. Though Vietnam banned the use of cryptocurrencies as means of payment, other products related to blockchain technology are still actively developed.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: 400;">Along with surges from global “big players” such as eBay allowing NFT sellers on its platform, or in Vietnam, Tiki launched a membership classification system with Astra, blockchain technology has the potential in leading the “Web 3.0 revolution” soon. With an industry as complex and disruptive as blockchain, many employers thirsts for talent. Developers in this field can expect a salary of thousands of dollars. Many businesses are even ready to hunt talented developers simply “interested in blockchain technology.”</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">So, what is blockchain, and how to develop a career in this challenging industry?</p>
      <h1 style="font-size: 32px"><strong>Blockchain Definition For Developers</strong></h1>
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain is a distributed (decentralized) database system formed as blocks linked together using cryptography. Similar to traditional databases: MySQL, MongoDB, etc. We can use blockchain to store data. However, the following characteristics are what set blockchain apart from the rest:</p>
      <ul>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Immutability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Data in a blockchain is unmodifiable. Since numerous computers far and near store such data, it cannot be deleted or destroyed.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Transparency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Anyone can track data on the blockchain.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Confidentiality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: No one can tamper with the data on the blockchain since it applies cryptography, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, and game theory (the majority decides the data reliability and accuracy).</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">The following example demonstrates the indispensable role and confirms the future trend of Blockchain:</p>
      <ul>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more technology develops, the more demand for global solutions rises. For global solutions, safety and transparency always come first.</spanp></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example is the asset management system: Administrators can easily change information to increase their own money or take other people's money. In cases where the property management system is damaged without proper and timely backup, your money will also disappear. Blockchain can solve all these problems well.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h1 style="font-size: 32px"><strong>Top Blockchain Platforms</strong></h1>
      <h2><strong>Bitcoin - The first product of Blockchain technology</strong></h2>
      <b>Bitcoin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was one of the first blockchain networks, built with the sole purpose of sending and receiving money. However, for global solutions, simply transferring money is not enough. Therefore, later blockchain networks start to allow developers to build DApps on their platforms.</span>
      <h2><strong>Ethereum and Solana - Programmable blockchain platforms</strong></h2>
      <ul>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not stopping at mere cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, </p><b>Ethereum helps create online markets</b><p style="font-weight: 400;"> with programmable transactions, also known as smart contracts.</span></li>
         <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Ethereum, </span><b>Solana is a fully decentralized open-source blockchain platform</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed for peer-to-peer transactions, creating smart contracts, and building DApps and NFTs.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Which to develop on, Ethereum or Solana?</strong></h2>
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">Solana and Ethereum are both open-source blockchains that allow storing Decentralized Apps (DApps). These DApps provide services and products in many areas such as finance, games, and more.</p>
      
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><b>Solana is considerably faster and cheaper</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than Ethereum.</span>
      
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">Why the difference? Let's learn more about the states of these two blockchain platforms:</p>
      
      <b>Ethereum has a “stateful” architecture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, capable of storing its data and state. Every transaction on the network is recorded in the same state, so the entire network will have to update the copy every time a new transaction occurs.</span>
      
      <p style="font-weight: 400;">For example: If you send someone $10 via Ethereum, the entire Ethereum network will have to update its state to add your transaction to the system.</p>
      
      <b>Solana has a “stateless” architecture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, similar to the first generation of computers that used punch cards. Data is entered into the machine via pre-punched cards by the developer, which reduces overall memory consumption. As a result, the network does not need to be wholly updated every time there is a transaction, thereby helping Solana's processing time shorten significantly and increasing scalability compared to Ethereum.</span>
